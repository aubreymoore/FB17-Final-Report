  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery and release of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s and 70s suppressed the pest such that no new invasions of uninfested islands by CRB were reported for over 30 years after implementation of the biocontrol programme. Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); Oâ€™ahu, Hawaiâ€™i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations. CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.},

	abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the coconut rhinoceros beetle  (CRB)  (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is large invasive scarab beetle native to
	Southeast Asia. CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and 
	most recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family 
	Nudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range. CRB 
	arrived  in  Oahu  in  2013  and  an  intensive  eradication  effort  is  currently  underway.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is to  determine  whether  OrNV  is 
	present in Oahu’s incipient CRB population, as its presence may positively impact eradication efforts. To date, 21 field-caught CRB specimens have 
	been assayed for OrNV using a PCR-based assay, all of which have been determined to be negative for the virus. This suggests that OrNV did not 
	accompany CRB during its invasion of Oahu, and/or CRB on Oahu are resistant to the virus. We also assayed CRB specimens from several locations 
	in Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands for the presence of OrNV and examined the genetic diversity of the virus within a 945 bp region of the gene 
	coding  for  the  gp83-like  protein. OrNV  could  be  found  in  all  locations  from  which  specimens  were  collected,  with  the  island  of Guam  being  an 
	exception. Sequence analyses of OrNV isolates indicate low genetic diversity, which may limit the genotypes of CRB this virus may be able to infect.},

	abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},

abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected
	on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication
	program, we attempted to establish effective
	microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus
	(OrNV) imported from AgResearch New Zealand
	and green muscardine fungus (GMF), Metarhizium
	majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut
	Authority. OrNV was initially released by
	autodissemination but did not result in population
	suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the
	Guam population is genetically distinct from other
	populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and
	laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is
	resistant to infection by OrNV isolates commonly
	used and released in the Pacific region. This novel
	biotype has been named CRB Biotype G (CRB-G) and
	it is spreading throughout the Pacific. GMF was
	released by autodissemination and incorporation of
	spores into CRB breeding sites. An extensive post-
	release survey indicated that field mortality from
	GMF was between 10\% and 38\%. Population
	suppression by GMF coupled with breeding site
	sanitation and other integrated pest management
	tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide
	CRB outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which
	passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging
	from abundant CRB breeding sites generated by this
	typhoon were numerous enough to kill large
	numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive
	feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead
	palms kill even more palms. History indicates that
	the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak
	on Guam is to find and release an OrNV isolate
	which is pathogenic for CRB-G. We are currently
	locating populations of CRB-G biotype within its
	native range and looking for OrNV isolates from
	these populations which can be used for effective
	microbial control.},

  volume = {50},
  abstract = {Although the use of aggregation pheromones has been reported for hundreds of nonsocial arthropod species, the evolutionary ecological aspects of this behavior have received little attention. Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation pheromones are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones, and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation pheromones. We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation pheromones with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of pheromones can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.},

  abstract = {Introduced mammals are major drivers of extinction. Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide.With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.},

  title = {A New Invasive Biotype of the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle ({{Oryctes}} Rhinoceros) Has Escaped from Biocontrol by {{Oryctes}} Rhinoceros Nudivirus},
  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; CRB) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s has enabled the successful management of populations in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism for CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For \textasciitilde{}40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing countries and islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. However, the situation has recently changed. For first time in \textasciitilde{}40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas has been reported in the Pacific, being detected first in Tumon Bay in Guam 2007, followed by Port Moresby in PNG 2010, Honolulu in Hawaii 2013, and Honiara in Solomon Islands 2015. Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g. Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage. Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage, not seen since the introduction of OrNV. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the CRB-G population that invaded Guam could be tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied OrNV isolates. Analysis of several CRB populations has demonstrated that the CRB-G biotype is also found in Hawaii, Palau, and recently (February 2015) in Port Moresby (PNG), with Honiara (Solomon Islands) still to be confirmed. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.},

However, its efficacy is not sufficient to provide acceptable levels of control in natural (orchard) conditions. A laboratory colony derived from resistant codling moths was established, which exhibited a homogeneous genetic background and a resistance level more than 7000 fold. By successive cycles of replication of NPP-R1 in this colony, we observed a progressive increase in efficacy. After 16 cycles (isolate 2016-r16), the efficacy of the virus isolate was equivalent to that of CpGV-M on susceptible insects. This isolate was able to control both CpGV-M-susceptible and CpGV-M-resistant insects with similar efficacy. No reduction in the levels of occlusion body production in susceptible larvae was observed for 2016-r16 compared to CpGV-M.},

Compared with stumps and coconut trunks on the ground, dead standing palms were preferred for breeding and contained baculovirus-infected larvae 5- to 15-fold more frequently. The percentage of baculovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again. Larva mortality was higher in dead standing palms and stumps than in trunks on the ground. Rainfall was also a significant mortality factor. Palm damage due to O. rhinoceros increased with density of stumps and trunks on the ground but not with density of dead standing palms. It is concluded that in the Philippines dead standing palms can play an important role in spread of baculovirus and regulation of O. rhinoceros populations.},

Olfactometer studies indicated that the aggregation pheromone of red palm weevil and 24 April 2013 rhinoceros beetle attracted significantly more number of weevils (13.4 females and 7.6 male weevils) and beetles (6.5 male and 12.3 female beetles), respectively than control. Similarly, field studies found that both Revised received: 750 and 1000 mg pheromone dosage lures of red palm weevil and rhinoceros beetle trapped significantly 02 September 2013 higher numbers of weevils (695.80 and 789 weevils, respectively) and beetles (98 and 108 beetles, respectively) in traps (P{$<$}0.05), respectively. On an average (n=6 field trials) 80-85\% red palm weevil and Re-revised received: 72-78\% rhinoceros beetle population got trapped. Observations indicated activity of red palm weevil 26 October 2013 throughout the year and of rhinoceros beetle from September to March around Bangalore, South India. Pheromone traps for red palm weevil can be placed in fields from June to August and October to December Accepted: and September to February for rhinoceros beetle.

  title = {Oryctes Rhinoceros Population Diversity and Potential Implications for Control Using {{Oryctes}} Nudivirus},
  abstract = {The discovery of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s by Dr
Alois Huger enabled the successful management of coconut
rhinoceros beetle (Orytes rhinoceros) populations through
classical biocontrol release in the Pacific, SE Asian, and Indian
Ocean regions. OrNV continues to be an important biocontrol
agent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and
oil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of OrNV is
commonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its
continued presence within palm growing regions and
surrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution
of the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have
established in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle
was discovered in Guam and the population has now
established with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not
seen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the
Guam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has
raised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded
Guam is less susceptible to OrNV, or potentially resistant.
Furthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O.
rhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed
to have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros
invasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of
a virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be
on the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source
populations for the Guam outbreak, a simple PCR-RFLP
method has been developed to distinguish Guam O.
rhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O.
rhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian
beetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam.
We will discuss current results in relation to what is known
about these new invasions and potential implications for the
future.},

The abundance of beetles is surprising given that the Malay peninsula was the site of first discovery of the Oryctes virus, which has been used to effect good as a biological control agent in other regions. A survey of adult beetles was carried out throughout Malaysia using pheromone traps. Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and PCR detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral DNA analysis was carried out after restriction with HindIII enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.},

In practice, varying concentrations of purified virus are preincubated with a fixed dilution of heterologous or homologous antiserum and the unbound antibodies present in the mixture are back titrated with virus particles bound to microtitre plates. The antigenic relationship is described in terms of differentiation index (DI) and total antigenic reactivity (TAR).

The transfer vector, a pUC8-based plasmid, contained the polyhedrin gene from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, flanked by Oryctes baculovirus DNA from the HindIII fragment N. Oryctes baculovirus does not form plaques with DSIR-HA-1179 cells. Therefore an endpoint dilution method was used to screen for, recover and purify recombinants. There was no phenotypic character that could be used for detecting recombinants, so a dot blot assay was used to screen infected cultures for the presence of recombinants. A recombinant generated by this method contained the entire polyhedrin gene inserted at 98.03 map units from the designated start of the Oryctes baculovirus physical map. No evidence of transcription or translation of the polyhedrin gene was obtained.},

  volume = {65},
  abstract = {The DSIR-HA-1179 coleopteran cell line is a susceptible and permissive host to the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), which has been used as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros); a pest of palms in the Asia-Pacific region. However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale OrNV production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize DSIR-HA-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with TrypLE Express\texttrademark{} with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely TC-100, IPL-41, Sf-900 II and Sf-900 III and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 II (17.9 \texttimes{} 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of OrNV was observed in IPL-41 and TC-100 (4.1 \texttimes{} 10(7) TCID50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 III (2.0 \texttimes{} 10(7) TCID50/ml) and Sf-900 II (1.4 \texttimes{} 10(7) TCID50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in TC-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the TC-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.},

  abstract = {In view of the increasing and devastating damage by rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) to coconut palms in the middle of last century, many efforts were made to find an efficient natural control factor against this pest, which could not be controlled by pesticides. The basic procedures of these monitoring programmes are outlined together with the final detection of a virus disease in oil palm estates in Malaysia in 1963. In extensive laboratory studies, the virus was isolated and identified as the first non-occluded, rod-shaped insect virus, morphologically resembling the baculoviruses. Infection experiments clarified the pathology, histopathology, and virulence of the virus and demonstrated that the virus was extremely virulent to larvae after peroral application. These findings encouraged the first pilot release of virus in 1967 in coconut plantations of Western Samoa where breeding sites were contaminated with virus. Surprisingly, the virus became established in the Samoan rhinoceros beetle populations and spread autonomously throughout the Western Samoan islands. As a consequence, there was a drastic decline of the beetle populations followed by a conspicuous recovery of the badly damaged coconut stands. This unexpected phenomenon could only be explained after it was shown that the adult beetle itself is a very active virus vector and thus was responsible for the efficient autodissemination of the virus. The functioning of the beetle as a 'flying virus factory' is due to the unique cytopathic process developing in the midgut after peroral virus infection. Pathological details of this process are presented. Because of the long-term persistence of the virus in the populations, rhinoceros beetle control is maintained. Incorporation of virus into integrated control measures and successful virus releases in many other countries are recorded. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several fights among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported. \textcopyright{} 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros is an important pest attacking young oil palms in South-east Asia. In Malaysia, in addition to well-known breeding sites it is able to multiply in shredded chipped old oil palm trunk material in replant areas, also in empty fruit bunches. The aggregation pheromone ethyl 4-methyloctanoate is produced by males of O. rhinoceros (also by the similar pest O. monoceros in Africa), and is used in traps as an important component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and in ecological studies. In Malaysia, the incidence of endemic entomopathogens can be increased. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is available for use as a biopesticide against immature stages in breeding sites and may be distributed by adults. The molecular and ultrastructure of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) has been extensively studied. It kills larvae and is disseminated by adults. New PCR techniques may enable reliable estimates of the quantity of virions in experimental dosages ingested and hence of the virulence of different isolates. It is possible one isolate when released may out compete another.\textbackslash{}n},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the coconut rhinoceros beetle  (CRB)  (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is large invasive scarab beetle native to
Southeast Asia. CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and 
most recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family 
Nudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range. CRB 
arrived  in  Oahu  in  2013  and  an  intensive  eradication  effort  is  currently  underway.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is to  determine  whether  OrNV  is 
present in Oahu's incipient CRB population, as its presence may positively impact eradication efforts. To date, 21 field-caught CRB specimens have 
been assayed for OrNV using a PCR-based assay, all of which have been determined to be negative for the virus. This suggests that OrNV did not 
accompany CRB during its invasion of Oahu, and/or CRB on Oahu are resistant to the virus. We also assayed CRB specimens from several locations 
in Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands for the presence of OrNV and examined the genetic diversity of the virus within a 945 bp region of the gene 
coding  for  the  gp83-like  protein. OrNV  could  be  found  in  all  locations  from  which  specimens  were  collected,  with  the  island  of Guam  being  an 
exception. Sequence analyses of OrNV isolates indicate low genetic diversity, which may limit the genotypes of CRB this virus may be able to infect.},

  abstract = {The powder formulation of Metarhizium anisopliae was applied by spraying method onto the rotting heaps of oil palm residues under the leguminous cover crops. The M. anisopliae infected all stages of Oryctes rhinoceros. At eight months after treatment (MAT), the application of product at rates of T1, 0.2 g (2.2 x 10 7 spores) and T2, 0.4 g (4.4 x 10 7 spores) m -2 heap was significantly reduced (P{$<$}0.05) the L2 and L3 larvae, pre-pupae and pupae. Reduction of these four stages has reduced the overall O. rhinoceros population in T1 to 30.8 individual per sampling plot (ISP) and T2 to 41.0 ISP, significant lower (P{$<$}0.05) as compared to population in the control (132.1 ISP). The growing of cover crops delayed the impact time of the fungus, but it provided protection to the fungus from the detrimental factors, giving favourable conditions to the spores to grow and initiate infection. Therefore, at eight MAT, as the population was significantly reduced, the infection levels were increased to 33.3\% in T1 and 30.4\% in T2, both were significantly higher (P{$<$}0.05) as compared to control (12.9\%). Then it was further increased to 52.0\% (control), 67.8\% (T1) and 72.9\% (T2) at 12 MAT. The use of the product at both rates did not affect the non-target insects. The oil palm pollinating weevil, Elaeidobius kamerunicus was not affected as they was no difference in the population density in the treated and control plots. The population density of the stag beetle, Aegus chelifer in both treated plots was always not significant (P{$>$}0.05) with the control at all times of data recording. Although infection can occur on larvae and adults, but the percentage was low, ranging from 0\% -0.6\% at five MAT and 1.7\% and 2.5\% at eight MAT.},

The cell cultures were derived from the dynastine beetle Heteronychus arator, the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda, and the mosquito Aedes albopictus. The criteria for virus replication were synthesis of virus-specific DNA and presence of virus particles within cells. Infection occurred in H. arator cells but not in S. frugiperda cells. When A. albopictus cells were inoculated with high concentrations of Oryctes baculovirus virus uptake and syncytia formation occurred but there was no evidence of virus replication and thus infection probably did not occur. It is suggested therefore that a previous report of replication of Oryctes baculovirus in both S. frugiperda and A. albopictus cells is incorrect and an alternative interpretation of this report is proposed.},

Pest populations were monitored by palm damage surveys for up to 4 yr on 22 islands, some of them deliberately untreated. The method used allowed estimates from a single survey of the number of beetle attacks during each of 18 mo (3rd\textendash{}20th month before the survey date). Such surveys gave continuous records for O. rhinoceros attacks during 1983\textendash{}1987. Most islands where the virus was released showed a highly significant reduction in palm damage. The prerelease pest density on a given island influenced the efficacy of the virus introduction. Adjustments were made for this effect when the performances of the different virus strains were compared. Strain X2B gave consistently better reduction in pest populations and more virus-infected beetles compared with strain V2/3B; the remaining strains gave intermediate control. These results agreed with earlier laboratory tests, in which the virulence of both strains was compared by infecting O. rhinoceros larvae. Two islands where three strains were released simultaneously also experienced a high damage reduction; here, X2B predominated eventually over strains V2/3B and S2A.},

Two cloned PstI fragments, C and D, of OrV DNA have been sequenced, consisting of 19,805 and 17,146bp, respectively, and comprising about 30\% of the OrV genome. For each of the two fragments, 20 open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 nucleotides or greater with no or minimal overlap were predicted. Ten of the predicted 40 ORFs revealed significant similarities to Heliothis zea virus 1 (HzV-1) ORFs, of which five, lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, dnapol and ac81, are homologues of conserved core genes in the family Baculoviridae, and one is homologous to baculovirus rr1. A baculovirus odv-e66 homologue is also present in OrV. Five ORFs encode proteins
homologous to cellular thymidylate synthase (TS), patatin-like phospholipase, mitochondrial carrier protein, Ser=Thr protein phosphatase, and serine protease, respectively. TS is phylogenetically related to those of eukarya and nucleo-cytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses. However, the remaining 25 ORFs have poor or no sequence matches with the current databases. Both the gene content of the sequenced fragments and the phylogenetic analyses of the viral DNA polymerase suggest that OrV is most closely related to HzV-1. These findings and the re-evaluation of the relationship of HzV-1 to baculoviruses suggest that a new virus genus, Nudivirus, should be established, containing OrV and HzV-1, which are genetically related to members of the family Baculoviridae.},

Later releases took place in Tonga, Fiji and other Pacific Islands. The virus rapidly established and caused high levels of infection that spread as epizootics through the beetle populations. The virus killed larvae in breeding sites and caused adult beetles to cease feeding, leading to reduced damage and a decline in fecundity of the pest population. Researchers reported spectacular declines in the treated populations within 1\textendash{}3 years of application. Reapplication has proven effective where there has been a resurgence of beetle damage. After 40 years from the initial releases, high palm damage has been reported from some areas suggesting a breakdown of control. Selection of more virulent strains and improved methods of application could overcome these problems.},

The replication of three types of OrNV, the  types A, B, and C in the insect cell line DSIR-HA-1179 was studied. The cells were grown in PS100 media containing 10\% fetal bovine serum. The signs of infection in cells by all types of OrNV were clearly seen at 10 to 14 days after treatment (DAT). The infected cells experienced cytopathic effects (CPE) involving formation of high number of vesicle or globule like-structures around the cells. The density of viable cells in flasks inoculated by the nudivirus decreased over time. At 16 DAT, the viable cell density in flasks inoculated with OrNV types A, B, and C was 1.49 \texttimes{} 105, 0.29 \texttimes{} 105, and 4.78 \texttimes{} 105 cells ml-1 respectively, significantly lower (P{$<$}0.05) compared to control flask of 7.98 \texttimes{} 105 cells ml-1. Based on the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50\% (TCID50), it was found that the OrNV type B was more virulent than the OrNV types A and C as it produced high infectious virus particles. The TCID50 values for the OrNV types A and C were 3.00 \texttimes{} 107 infectious unit (IU ml-1) and 8.03 x 105 IU ml-1 as compared to type B which was 7.09 \texttimes{} 107 IU ml-1. The PCR analysis showed that all types of OrNV had successfully replicated in the cells as early as 4 DAT. Pathogenicity study on neonates using cells-propagated OrNV has again showed that the OrNV type B was more pathogenic than the other types of OrNV. The LT50 value for the OrNV type B was 33.47 days, shorter than  the OrNV type A (49.35 days) and the OrNV type C (48.58 days). The DNA profiles of OrNV extracted from dead infected neonates in the bioassay were the same as those from infected gut tissues collected from field population.

Males typically flew within 5 m of the ground, took erratic flight paths with numerous turns, and frequently circled coconuts and other host plants.

Sterilization, disinfection, and antisepsis are important for preventing diseases derived
from pathogens such as viruses. The disinfectants used for viruses are mostly chemicals
including alcohols like ethanol and isopropanol. Alcohols are effective against enveloped
viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus but not small
non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus and poliovirus. To develop methods of
sterilization, confirmation of results using appropriate samples is necessary. Towards this
goal, several physical methods have recently been developed to facilitate sterilization;
including the use of pulsed light, supercritical fluids, pulsed electric fields, and gas
plasma. Although most of these methods have not been widely adopted, further increases
in reliability, convenience, and suitability should contribute to the spread of their
applicability. In this review, we describe viruses, conventional means of disinfection,
trends in the development of new methods of sterilization and potential applications of
these methods.},

In the current study, pheromone traps were used to monitor the immigration and activity pattern of Oryctes adults within a 4.5 ha replanting block. Trapping was initiated after about five months of replanting, for a period of 24 months. The relationships of the trap captures with the heap population, palm damage, rainfall and moon phases were also studied. Infestation of the block occurred almost simultaneously with replanting. The core region of the block was infested between the fourth to seventh month after completion of felling and chipping. It was noted that female beetles were trapped consistently more at the fringes than in the core of the replanting block. There was a significant relationship between the number of adult females trapped (at about 40-60 days before monitoring the population in the heaps) and the number of second instar larvae. There was an increase in the flight activity of the beetle (based on trap captures) during wet weather, likely due to their search for moist breeding sites. Male beetles were more active during the full moon, likely navigating for food and searching for suitable habitats before mating. Cumulative captures of each individual trap and the damage levels of adjacent palms were significantly related. A high proportion (92\%) of females captured in the traps were gravid, with a mean of 16 eggs per female. Based on trap captures, there were indications that adult populations were coming from the adjacent mature plantings. This information can be exploited for more effective and targeted control of the pest.},

  volume = {143},
  abstract = {any forest-defoliating Lepidoptera exhibit long-term cyclic fluctuations in density that span several orders of magnitude. One hypothesis to explain these fluctuations is that they are driven by pathogens with long-lived infectious stages capable of surviving outside the host. The basis of the argument is that, for realistic parameter values, a mathematical disease model incorporating such an infectious stage is likely to show cycles with the same period as is observed in nature. The mathematical model used to make this argument, however, is so simple that it may not be biologically meaningful. In this article, I extend the original model by including two realistic complications: density-dependent host reproduction and host movement behavior. Including density-dependent host reproduction greatly increases the likelihood of cycles; addi tional realism thus strengthens the original conclusion. Including host movement behavior makes the model more versatile, as it allows comparison of the model output with literature data on the spatial spread of insect viruses. This comparison suggests that the spatial spread of the viruses of Gilpinia hercyniae and Oryctes rhinoceros can be explained with a very simple model of host movement, without recourse to complicated mechanisms of dispersal. The introduction of host movement behavior also introduces the possibility of cycles of outbreaks in space and time simultaneously-that is, waves of disease that will reappear at regular intervals.},

The beetles' habit of burrowing into breeding sites and into the coconut palm crown, together with the low value of the crop precludes the use of insecticides for control. Biological control agents must be able to penetrate these living places in order to be successful. The success of the Project is attrib- uted to the discovery and use of a baculovirus. Its success in reducing beetle numbers preceded the research on its ecology and safety and also curtailed other research direc- tions.

  volume = {21},
  abstract = {The rhinoceros beetles Oryctes boas (F.) and O. monoceros (Oliv.) do serious damage to coconut palms in Zanzibar and East Africa. These beetles breed in decaying wood, particularly decaying palm trunks, and in manure and compost heaps. They lay their eggs in the decaying vegetable matter, often boring well inside to do so. The eggs, white and the size of mustard seeds, hatch in 7 to 9 days. The larvae take between one hundred and two hundred days to reach maturity according to temperature and availability of food; and the pupal stage lasts from 14 to 21 days. Damage is caused by the adult beetles since they bore into the growing tip of the palm: in some cases this kills the palm, particularly if it is a young one, but generally it causes a considerable reduction in leaf area and distortion of the palm. Mansfield-Aders (1920) reports that Oryctes spp. caused serious damage in Zanzibar and that no insect parasites had been found. During the nineteen thirties it was discovered that the scolliid wasp Scalia ruficornis F. was a parasite on the larvae of Oryctes spp. and was considered to exercise considerable control of Oryctes spp. in Zanzibar, although there were no data to support this. Surveys of the numbers of Oryctes larvae parasitized by S. ruficornis have only shown about 10 maximal parasitism and it is doubtful whether this would be sufficient to keep the beetle in check. Agriculture hygiene, such as burying all decaying logs and vegetation, has done a great deal to check the pest. Scolliid wasps have been collected in Zanzibar by several people and, in some cases, introduced with great success in other parts of the world. Recently Dr. Dun of Kew Guinea collected scolliids here and he informs me that these are now well established near Keravat, New Guinea. Although the scolliid wasp has been successful in controlling Oryctes in other countries where it has been introduced I did not feel satisfied that it was solely responsible for the high degree of natural control prevailing here in Zanzibar. In one coconut plantation the Department of Agriculture havc large compost heaps. These heaps breed numerous Oryctes spp. and counts on various occasions have indicated that under 10 \% of these are parasitized by S. rujlcornis. Since numerous pupae and freshly emerged adults of Oryctes spp. can generally be found in these heaps, it would be natural to expect a high rate of Oryctes damage in the surrounding coconut palms. In actual fact, there appears less Oryctes damage in this plantation than elsewhere, where there are no compost heaps breeding Oryctes. While examining the crowns of the palms in this area for Pseudotheraptus damage, I was astonished by the numbers of dead Oryctes adults that were present in the debris that collects in the axils of the leaves, and also very painfully made aware of the presence of the assassin bug Platymerus rhadamanthus Gerst. hiding in this debris. Most of the dead Oryctes spp. were merely hollow exoskeletons, and each one had a sizeable hole in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. In what appeared freshly killed specimens small ants such as Plagiolepis brunni Mayr, Crematogaster nr rectinota For., Semonius schultzei For., Cardiocondyla wroughtoni For. and Tapinoma luleus Em. were often observed cleaning the inside of the dead beetle through this hole. It seemed that there might be some connection between the assassin bug P. rhadamanthus and these dead Oryctes spp., so several living adult P. rhudamanthus were captured and male and female Oryctes sp. were offered for food. It was observed that P. rhadamanthus immediately seized and pierced Oryctes by inserting its proboscis in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. The beetles ceased to struggle after 15 to 20 seconds and the assassin bug spent two or three hours feeding on the dead Orytes. Examination of these dead Oryctes failed to show any obvious "hole" where P. rlwdamanthus had fed; the puncture was, no doubt, enlarged later by one of the ant species previously mentioned. Following the above observations further work was undertaken on P. rhadamanthus. During July 1957 Dr. P. Surany of the South Pacific High Commission visited Zanzibar and searched for the presence of fungous and virus diseases of Oryctes larvae. He is of the opinion that a large percentage of the Oryctes larvae are infected, and that virus and fungous diseases cause a high mortality amongst the larvae. Nevertheless, from an examination of compost heaps and rotting logs it was concluded that a considerable number of adults must l,ave emerged.},

  abstract = {Abstract The infestation levels of O. rhinoceros were investigated in the oil palm trunk heaps in three replanting blocks (Blocks A, B and C) at Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. These blocks had different densities of pheromone trapping: high (11 traps per ha, Block B), normal (1 trap per 2 ha, Block C), while no pheromone trapping was conducted in (Block A. Without pheromone trapping, the infestation levels of O. rhinoceros can reach a maximum density of between 25 to 50 individuals per m2 (IPMS). The O. rhinoceros population was still detected in the heaps up to more than two years (at 26 months after replanting). With high density trapping, infestation levels were maintained below 10 IPMS and was not detected in the heaps after a period of 16 months of replanting. In the normal trapping density, the population was also maintained below 10 IPMS but had sustained itself in the heaps for up to 24 months. The mortality factors associated with the larval stages sampled within these replanting blocks was determined by visual symptoms with subsequent verification with microbial analysis. The analysis was narrowed down to detect only bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis and B. popillae), virus (Oryctes virus) and fungus (Metarhizium). In Block A, the population of O. rhinoceros in the trunks was reduced drastically at 14 months after replanting (MAR), which could be due to the high mortality (88\%) of the third instar larvae, 3 months earlier. In Block B, the percentage mortality for the larval stage was always highest at the third instars (between 21-82\%). In Block C however, the mortality of the third instars was low, never exceeding 35\%. In these sampling blocks, the infection of Metarhizium seem to be less dominant compared to virus or bacteria The k factor analysis indicates density dependence among the third instar larvae had contributed to the change in its population density in Block A. Therefore, with proper manipulation of pheromone traps and targeted application of disease agents (i.e virus,fungus and bacteria), the population of O. rhinoceros can be managed more effectively in an oil palm replanting.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) breeding sites and damage to coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.) were surveyed in the Republic of the Maldives before and after the introduction of a baculovirus disease and in untreated areas of the Indonesian provinces of North and South Sulawesi. The results and those of previous surveys showed that the baculovirus disease usually has little influence on the overall survival rate of O. rhinoceros larvae, but that it reduces dramatically the average life span of the adult beetles. This and the ability of the virus disease to persist at low host densities are the main reasons for its success as a microbial control agent. The data provide additional evidence that the presence of a low number of dead standing palms per hectare promotes the spread of the virus disease because these are highly attractive to adult beetles. It is concluded from the results that in areas where the baculovirus is indigenous, control methods should be directed against the larval population of O. rhinoceros.},

The virus disease developed to epizootic levels within 5 months and spread across the island in 15 months.

The greater impact of the virus was attributed to its much higher power of dispersal through infected beetles.

No virus infections occurred in larvae hatching from eggs surface-contaminated with the virus. Larvae hatching from eggs laid by virus-infected females very rarely were infected.

In the O. rhinoceros population the virus is transmitted most frequently during mating, possibly when the uninfected partner contacts virus material excreted by the infected partner. The virus can be transmitted in a similar way when infected and healthy beetles feed together in palm trees. Beetles visiting larval breeding sites containing freshly virus-killed larvae can become infected. Virus-infected beetles can pass the infection to healthy larvae when visiting a breeding site.},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {During investigations on the pathology of field populations of Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus) in Southeast Asia and in certain islands of the South Pacific, grubs suffering from a virus disease were detected in Malaya. Signs and symptoms of this so-called ``Malaya disease'' are described. In diseased larvae, the fat body is greatly disintegrated. Fat cells often show a striking proliferative response to virus infection. By differential centrifugation of suspensions of homogenized affected fat-body lobes, spherical viral particles with mostly polygonal contours and an average diameter of 164 {$\pm$} 16 m{$\mu$} could be isolated together with a comparatively low number of virus rods measuring about 200 \texttimes{} 70 m{$\mu$}. These viral sediments proved highly infective for larvae when inoculated into the body cavity. The same was the case with filtrates of homogenized fat body of diseased larvae when filters with a mean pore size of 1 micron, 600 m{$\mu$}, and 300 m{$\mu$} were used. Injection of filtrates passed through 100-m{$\mu$}-pore filters had no apparent effect on the larvae, yet the emerging adults were crippled.

Ultrathin sections revealed that the nuclei of fat-body cells are the principal sites of virus reproduction, yet repeatedly virogenic foci could also be observed in the cytoplasm. In an advanced stage of cell infection the hypertrophied nuclei contain crowds of singleor double-membraned spherical viral particles (shells), most of them ranging in diameter from 120 to 230 m{$\mu$} (mean 160 m{$\mu$}), and, closely associated with them, masses of virus rods with a length predominantly ranging from 170 to 210 m{$\mu$} (mean 195 m{$\mu$}) and an average width of 70 m{$\mu$}. Both components are identical with the isolated spheres and rods. The virus rods, being the mature form of the virus, have a highly differentiated structure. They are established (1) from dense, chromatinlike virogenic stroma, (2) from loose, fibrillar and granular stromal material, (3) from filaments, and (4) from inside of the single- or double-membraned spherical particles (shells). Thus, the spheres represent viral developmental stages. The virus rods are not occluded in polyhedra or capsules of microcrystalline proteinaceous material. Yet clusters of rods may be densely packed in a two- or three-dimensional pseudocrystalline pattern.

The disease is easily transmissible to third-instar larvae by contaminated food as well as by intrahemocoelic inoculation. The period of lethal infection is from about 6 to 30 days. Peroral and intrahemocoelic transmission of the disease to larvae of Oryctes nasicornis (Linnaeus) also is easily effected.

The virus cannot be classed with any known group of insect viruses. Accordingly, it is placed in a new genus for which the generic name Rhabdionvirus gen.n. is proposed. The type species of this new genus (the virus under discussion) is named Rhabdionvirus oryctes gen. n., sp. n.},

One of the major challenges for eradication has been the identification of new breeding sites. Information on the factors influencing oviposition is needed to aid in finding sites likely to host the immature stages of this insect. In this study, a series of choice tests were conducted to assess the oviposition preferences of both laboratory-reared and wild-caught CRB. Mated females, of both lab-reared and wild-caught beetles, were offered for oviposition a choice between sand and two mulch substrates, one with small and one with large particle sizes. Both types of CRB laid eggs preferentially in substrate of small particle size rather than large and none laid eggs in sand. Labreared and wild-caught CRB differed in their oviposition behavior and size. These results can be used to aid in the identification of breeding sites for management programs and eradication efforts.},

Early detection of RPW infestation is crucial because,at an early stage of infestation,palms can be treated more efficiently and saved,while the determination of treatment efficacy is hugely vital to optimize palm rescue efforts.

Further data to correlate OrNV dosage indices with doses in number of virions/ml could be advantageous so as to explore if CRB larvae or adults may resist infection by a sub-threshold dose. Also the possibility of changes in the HA culture cells which alter the outer coat of the resulting virion, hence perhaps its infectivity towards CRB cells, could be checked. Might it be possible to move beyond HA-culture and develop tissue culture of Oryctes rhinoceros cells for mass production of OrNV as this beetle species is the target? Nuclear genomes of OrNV-resistant and OrNV-susceptible strains of the CRB could be examined for changes perhaps correlated with resistance.

They either cut through the frond butts or bore through the palm bases with their forelegs and feed on the inner soft tissues. A strain of Oryctes NudiVirus (Rhabdionvirus oryctes) was identified from Malaysia in the 1960s and used effectively for classical biological control of the pest. However, in 2007 a more destructive population of the beetle was found in Guam. Molecular analysis confirmed its genotype to be different from that of the common population and also to be resistant against NudiVirus infection. The new population has subsequently been referred to as the Guam biotype (CRB-G) whilst the common type has been referred to as the Samoan/Pacific biotype (CRB-S/P). In 2010, similar damage was noted on coconuts in Port Moresby, National Capital District, Papua New Guinea. Sympatric occurrence of both CRB-G and CRB-S in National Capital District with no NudiVirus infection on CRB-G has been confirmed. CRB-G has been found to be less responsive to the aggregation pheromone (ethyl 4-methyloctanoate) used for monitoring and control of O. rhinoceros. Only CRB-S is found in East New Britain, New Ireland and West New Britain with NudiVirus infection. Widespread severe damage was observed in National Capital District and Central Province, whilst severe damage in New Ireland, East New Britain and West New Britain were localised in areas with readily available breeding sites. Light damages were noted in some areas of Milne Bay, Northern and West New Britain Provinces, but most areas were free of damage. The results are discussed in relation to the impact CRB-G is likely to have on the palm industries in Papua New Guinea if no effective control options are put in place.},

the 11.8\textendash{}12 GHz band. A prototype of the radar unit was built and
tested, and a new small tag was designed for the application. The
new tag offers improved harmonic conversion efficiency and much
smaller size as compared to previous harmonic radar systems for
tracking insects. Unlike RFID detectors whose sensitivity allows
detection up to a few meters, the developed radar can detect a
tagged insect up to 58 m (190 ft).},

dispersal of tagged insects. The tag consists of a wire antenna attached to a Schottky diode, which uses the original radar signal as
an energy source, re-emitting a harmonic of the transmitted wavelength. Two forms of harmonic radar use this basic technology to
study insect movement. The more sophisticated form consists of a
ground-based scanning radar station that tracks the movement of a
tagged insect on a circular radar display. A simpler, ``off-the-shelf''
form of harmonic radar is a commercially available, light-weight,
handheld transmitter/receiver from RECCO Rescue Systems. We
briefly review both of these forms and describe our experience
monitoring the movement of carabid beetles in agricultural habitats
with the handheld transmitter/receiver. We identified a commercial
source of diodes compatible with the RECCO transmitter/receiver
and tested several diode and wire combinations. We found that a tag
built with a diode attached to a single section of 8-cm wire (monopole) was more appropriate for marking carabids. Tags built from
flexible Teflon-coated wires were an improvement on tags built with
stiff, aluminum wire, but beetle movement was still hindered. In corn
and soybean fields, large carabids (Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir and
Harpalus pennsylvanicus, (DeG.) Coleoptera: Carabidae) could be
recaptured even when they burrowed out of sight 3 to 9 cm below
the soil surface. We discuss the trade-offs between tag detection and
durability that occur when designing a tag for a given organism.
Although the technique shows promise, producing a tag that does
not hinder movement of the target insect in the field will require
further development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although portable harmonic radar system and fluorescent marking system are two widely used detection
methods, their comparative effectiveness has not been studied. Therefore, we first tested the applicability of fluorescent
marking system on Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae). Then, we evaluated the efficacy of the two methods used either
alone or combined in a grass field and bean field, varying with complexity, during day and night.
RESULTS: Fluorescent marking did not affect the behavior or fitness of Riptortus pedestris except for vertical walking, while
allowing the detection from {$>$}25 m when paired with a handheld laser. Generally, the portable harmonic radar system and both
methods combined were more successful in sample detection, although the fluorescent marking system in the bean field at night
was as competitive as the two. Combining both methods made sample retrieval easier at night than the portable harmonic radar
system. Nevertheless, the total detection time showed a large variance across the methods.
CONCLUSION: The portable harmonic radar system can be an effective detection method in either landscape during both day
and night. Furthermore, the fluorescent marking system can be a reliable tool at night as well. Lastly, combining both methods
can improve the night detection.

Until recently, however, it was not practicable to apply this powerful technique to low-altitude "foraging" flights (defined by Kennedy, 1985), i.e., flights to find food, mates, egg-laying
sites, and other resource items (Bell, 1991). This is because the strong radar
echoes from ground features and vegetation ("clutter") usually mask the very
tiny returns from insects. In principle, this constraint can be overcome by using
the harmonic transponder technique first suggested in 1967 (Vogler et al., 1967) and subsequently investigated for automobile collision avoidance systems (Shefer et al., 1974). In this technique, the target to be tracked is "tagged" with an harmonic transponder, in the form of an electrically nonlinear conductor
(usually a diode) attached to some form of antenna. The transponder picks up
energy from the illuminating radar and reradiates some of it at an harmonic of the original frequency: the radar receiver is selectively tuned to this new frequency and so is able to detect the transponder even in the presence of very strong clutter.},

direction. Two main styles of track were identified: (A) fast linear flight and (B) slower nonlinear flights
involving a period of foraging and/or looped sections of flight. These loops potentially perform an
orientation function, and were often associated with areas of forage. In the absence of forage, linear features
did not provide a guiding effect on flight direction, and only dense treelines were perceived as barriers. The
results provide tentative support for non-random dispersal and a perceptual range of 100\textendash{}200 m for these
species. This study has demonstrated a methodology of significant value for future investigation of butterfly

It is important in conservation biological control to understand the role that natural enemy movements play in the improvement of pest control achieved through the provision of pollen, nectar, shelter and/or alternative prey/hosts. Other aspects of predator and parasitoid movement pertinent to biological control are the role refugia play in influencing, via natural enemy movements, control of pest population numbers.

determined using video tracking software. Results varied within and between the three species
studied. The heaviest tag mounted on the pronotum of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa
decemlineata (Say), reduced its mean horizontal speed slightly but signi{\TH}cantly. The mean horizontal
speed of plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), was signi{\TH}cantly reduced by a light tag but
not by heavier tags. The mean horizontal speed of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera

Colorado potato beetle and the plum curculio slightly changed their climbing speed. Changes in the
walking speed were variable but remained well within the range of values recorded in the literature.
The impact of the additional tag weight was within the range of constraints to movement (e.g., slopes,
barriers, etc.) normally experienced by insects in their environment. The results con{\TH}rm that tags
presently available will have minimal impact on the walking behavior of Colorado potato beetle,
provide an estimate of the optimal tag weight for the plum curculio and show that a lighter tag and
a better attachment method are required for the western corn rootworm. Because of the ability of
insects to adapt to a wide range of landscapes and to their own body weight changes, the additional
tag weight had a limited impact compared with the value of the ecological information gathered using

  abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle is an important agricultural pest that is prevalent to cause serious damage on coconuts. One of the control methods for this pest is by using different potential breeding sites/substrates. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of organic waste substrates as trapping media for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB). The organic waste substrates tested were the saw dust (control), corn cobs, rice straw, decaying vegetables, decomposing banana stumps and leaves and animal manure as CRB attractant in log traps. Among the six organic waste substrates tested, animal manure and rice straw were the most promising substrates that can be used as CRB trapping media in terms of the number of eggs collected, with 56 and 19, respectively. Also, high mortality of developing larvae was observed in these substrates compared to saw dust.},

  abstract = {The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the OrNV disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on-site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was thus tested. To avoid the DNA extraction process, the LAMP assay used a 50-fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on-site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the OrNV infectivity with LAMP primers targeting the OrNV\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the LAMP specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with OrNV. The positive results were detected only from the OrNV-infected larvae.},

  abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery and release of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s and 70s suppressed the pest such that no new invasions of uninfested islands by CRB were reported for over 30years after implementation of the biocontrol programme. Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O'ahu, Hawai'i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations. CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) is a severe pest of coconut and other palms that has invaded the South Pacific in the last decade. The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle's extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear DNA to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle's native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle's invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial DNA provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear DNA proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.},

The virus DNA was extracted from the gut tissues by a robust method. Using a pair of specific primers, Primer 15a and 15b, infection was confirmed when the PCR product produced a single 945 bp DNA band.  The optimized concentrations of the PCR components were at 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM 10X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM Primer 15a and 15b, 0.5 U Taq-DNA polymerase and 0.4 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA).  All tested virus DNA concentrations at 0.085, 0.170 and 0.255 {$\mu$}g {$\mu$}l-1 were suitable for virus detection.  Addition of BSA (20 mg ml-1) at 0.4 mg in the reaction increased the PCR sensitivity. The method is capable of detecting OrV infection from DNA diluted one million times or equivalent to a virus DNA concentration as low as 2.23 pg {$\mu$}l-1. The PCR detected 83.2\% adult beetles from pheromone traps as being infected by OrV, 13.6\% higher (P{$<$}0.05) than the results based on observations on the gut morphological appearance (69.6\%). A typical OrV infection symptom is a swollen gut filled with milky fluid.  Of the 839 guts with this symptom, 97.6\% were diagnosed to be infected which was not significantly different (P{$>$}0.05) compared to the method based on gut morphological appearance. The PCR was also capable in detecting virus at an early infection stage and in dead adults with decayed tissues. Of the 307 adults that appeared to be healthy, 36.1\% of them were found to be infected.  As much as 61.6\% of dead adults with decayed tissues (N = 428) were diagnosed to be infected by the OrV.  The method can be used in further research studies relating to OrV for the management of the rhinoceros beetle.

The main carbohydrate constituents of lignocellulosic material are cellulose and hemicelluloses (a group of heteropolymers that includes xylans and mannans). The most important process in bioethanol production from lignocellulose is the bioconversion of polysaccharides into fermentable sugar. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been developed because it is the more environmentally approach. Since the cost of hydrolytic enzyme production is the major problem of the process, many type of research has been focused on lowering the cost of enzyme production, including screening for organisms with a novel enzyme. This present study was conducted to isolate and screen of the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic Bacteria from the gut of Oryctes rhinoceros L. larvae. The 3rd instars were used in this research. The research succeeded to isolate 11 bacterial isolates from the gut of O. rhinoceros larvae. The screening result demonstrated that bacterial isolates had cellulolytic (63.6\% of total isolates), xylanolytic (72.7\% of total isolates), and mannanolytic (100\% of total isolates) activity. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence, 10 isolates were classified into Bacillus and only 1 isolate was classified into Citrobacter. The GOR2 which was closely related to Bacillus pumilus vit bac1 has the highest cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities.

  issn = {1063-5157, 1076-836X},
  abstract = {Rapid and reliable identification of insects is important in many contexts, from the detection of disease vectors and invasive species to the sorting of material from biodiversity inventories. Because of the shortage of adequate expertise, there has long been an interest in developing automated systems for this task. Previous attempts have been based on laborious and complex handcrafted extraction of image features, but in recent years it has been shown that sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn to extract relevant features automatically, without human intervention. Unfortunately, reaching expert-level accuracy in CNN identifications requires substantial computational power and huge training data sets, which are often not available for taxonomic tasks. This can be addressed using feature transfer: a CNN that has been pretrained on a generic image classification task is exposed to the taxonomic images of interest, and information about its perception of those images is used in training a simpler, dedicated identification system. Here, we develop an effective method of CNN feature transfer, which achieves expert-level accuracy in taxonomic identification of insects with training sets of 100 images or less per category, depending on the nature of data set. Specifically, we extract rich representations of intermediate to high-level image features from the CNN architecture VGG16 pretrained on the ImageNet data set. This information is submitted to a linear support vector machine classifier, which is trained on the target problem. We tested the performance of our approach on two types of challenging taxonomic tasks: 1) identifying insects to higher groups when they are likely to belong to subgroups that have not been seen previously and 2) identifying visually similar species that are difficult to separate even for experts. For the first task, our approach reached {$>$}92\% accuracy on one data set (884 face images of 11 families of Diptera, all specimens representing unique species), and {$>$}96\% accuracy on another (2936 dorsal habitus images of 14 families of Coleoptera, over 90\% of specimens belonging to unique species). For the second task, our approach outperformed a leading taxonomic expert on one data set (339 images of three species of the Coleoptera genus Oxythyrea; 97\% accuracy), and both humans and traditional automated identification systems on another data set (3845 images of nine species of Plecoptera larvae; 98.6 \% accuracy). Reanalyzing several biological image identification tasks studied in the recent literature, we show that our approach is broadly applicable and provides significant improvements over previous methods, whether based on dedicated CNNs, CNN feature transfer, or more traditional techniques. Thus, our method, which is easy to apply, can be highly successful in developing automated taxonomic identification systems even when training data sets are small and computational budgets limited. We conclude by briefly discussing some promising CNNbased research directions in morphological systematics opened up by the success of these techniques in providing accurate diagnostic tools.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Viral diseases of crustaceans are increasingly recognised as challenges to shellfsh farms and
fsheries. Here we describe the frst naturally-occurring virus reported in any clawed lobster species.
Hypertrophied nuclei with emarginated chromatin, characteristic histopathological lesions of DNA
virus infection, were observed within the hepatopancreatic epithelial cells of juvenile European lobsters
(Homarus gammarus). Transmission electron microscopy revealed infection with a bacilliform virus
containing a rod shaped nucleocapsid enveloped in an elliptical membrane. Assembly of PCR-free
shotgun metagenomic sequencing produced a circular genome of 107,063bp containing 97 open
reading frames, the majority of which share sequence similarity with a virus infecting the black tiger
shrimp: Penaeus monodon nudivirus (PmNV). Multiple phylogenetic analyses confrm the new virus to
be a novel member of the Nudiviridae: Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). Evidence of occlusion
body formation, characteristic of PmNV and its closest relatives, was not observed, questioning the
horizontal transmission strategy of HgNV outside of the host. We discuss the potential impacts of HgNV
on juvenile lobster growth and mortality and present HgNV-specifc primers to serve as a diagnostic tool
for monitoring the virus in wild and farmed lobster stocks.},

  volume = {89},
  abstract = {Hemolymph of healthy grubs of Oryctes rhinoceros possesses trehalose content of 380\,{$\pm$}\,30 mg/dl that is five times higher than the content of glucose. Experimental stressors, either internal or external have resulted in the elevation of glucose through degradation of trehalose mediated by the elevated activity of trehalase; the hyperglycaemia was disproportionate with the decrease of trehalose content. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP), an important enzyme of the skeletal muscle of vertebrates was located in the cell free hemolymph of grubs, at an exponentially elevated level of 320\,{$\pm$}\,20 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}mols/min/mg protein. Both GP and Hexokinase showed a sharp reduction in activity under exposure to stressors. Accumulation of lactic acid along with an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed. Inhibition of GP activity by hyperglycaemia together with decline of hexokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, proves that the larvae might have adopted an energy conserving mechanism and thereby channelling glucose for the purpose of defense. Elevation of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase during stress may also help them to synthesis defensive chemicals like glutathione and polyols. Existence of such a wonderful biochemical mechanism helps them to thrive very well in cow dung pits a microenvironment possessing biotic and abiotic stressors, without undergoing diapause.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros, coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), was first confirmed as present in Honiara, Solomon Islands in January 2015. Based on initial delimiting surveys it was determined that it had likely been there for at least two generations before it was detected and that consequently eradication was not an option. Soon after, scientists at AgResearch, New Zealand, confirmed it was the 'G' (Guam) strain of the species that is not susceptible to the nudivirus that controls another strain of CRB elsewhere in the South Pacific. An emergency response plan was developed but due to inadequate financing implementation has been inconsistent and weak, consequently it has spread and is now reported on parts of seven islands. More recently some funding has become available and a three-pronged management approach is being implemented: sanitation to reduce populations by destroying breeding sites (rotting palm logs, green manure, compost and chicken manure), restricting spread through internal quarantines on shipping and biological control by identifying effective entomopathogens for the long term. Work to identify strains of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) effective against CRB-G is reported elsewhere in this symposium. Some preliminary details of work to introduce the green muscardine fungus, Metarhyzium anisopleae, are reported here.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a pestiferous beetle causing severe 
damage to coconut and other palms by boring into and feeding upon the crown tissue. Several 
tools are used to manage this beetle, including pheromone lured traps and the biocontrol agent, 
Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). The pheromone lure, ethyl 4-methyloctanoate, was 
assessed for its attractive ability towards the CRB-S and CRB-G haplotypes by comparing the 
distribution of the haplotypes in non trap-caught and trap-caught populations collected from 
Palau. A diagnostic qPCR assay was designed to detect OrNV, and was found to be a more 
sensitive and accurate method for OrNV detection compared to the conventional PCR assay. 
Finally, because the newly emerged CRB-G haplotype has acquired resistance to OrNV, RNA 
extractions were sent for high-throughput sequencing to discover other viruses present in O. 
rhinoceros. Three sequences were discovered to be similar in sequence to viruses of other insect 
species.},

  abstract = {The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the OrNV disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on-site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was thus tested. To avoid the DNA extraction process, the LAMP assay used a 50-fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on-site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the OrNV infectivity with LAMP primers targeting the OrNV\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the LAMP specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with OrNV. The positive results were detected only from the OrNV-infected larvae.},

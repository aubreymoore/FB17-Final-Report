\section{Summary}

Coming soon!




\newpage
\section{Background}

The major goal of this project is to find an effective biological
control agent for coconut rhinoceros beetle biotype G (CRB-G). 

Prior to arrival of CRB-G on Guam during 2007, coconut rhinoceros beetle
infestations of Pacific islands were readily controlled by classical
biological control using \textit{Oryctes} nudivirus (OrNV). Following a lack
of response to release of OrNV on Guam, research showed that the Guam
CRB population is a genetically distinct virus-resistant biotype which
has become known as CRB-G. This biotype is highly invasive and is
causing massive damage to coconut and oil palms in Papua New Guinea
and the Solomon Islands. CRB-G has also invaded Oahu and Rota. Eradication
attempts have been launched on these two islands. 

Additional goals for this project are to establish a CRB damage survey to evaluate efficacy of biocontrol and other tactics, and to maintain collaboration
among Pacific island entomologists working to find solutions for CRB-G
management. 





\section{Staffing}

Staff for this project currently comprises of only 2 people: the PI, Dr. Aubrey Moore, and a post-doc, Dr. James Grasela. 
\begin{itemize}

    \item Dr. James Grasela, an insect pathologist, has been hired for a term of 2 years with a grant from Department of Interior, Office of Island Affairs.

    \item Ian Iriarte, a graduate student and technician working on this project, resigned to accept a permanent job. Search for a replacement is under way.

\end{itemize}

\section{Bioassays of Candidate Biocontrol Agents for CRB-G}


\subsection{Haemocoel Injection Bioassays}

In this series of assays, we tested 4 islates of OrNV which had produced
by an insect cell culture at the AgResearch Laboratory in New Zealand.
Adult beetles were dosed by direct injection into the haemocoel. This
series is a preliminary test for pathogenicity. Insignificant differences
in mortality curves between virus treatment and the other two treatments
(control treatment and heat-inactivated virus) is an indicator of
pathogenicity. Gut tissue samples have been preserved for histology
and molecular analysis. 

The following is a brief summary of results. Details are provided
in the appended technical reports. Results indicate that isolates
DUG42 and MALB are not pathogenic for CRB-G, but isolates PNG and
V23B are pathogenic. Bioassays in which adult beetles are dosed \emph{per
os} are underway and results will be available in a future report.

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate DUG42}

Origin: Philippines; 2 replicates; 30 beetles in total

No significant differences among mortality cuves. {[}control, heat-inactivated
virus, virus{]}

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate MALB}

Origin: Malaysia; 2 replicates; 30 beetles in total

No significant differences among mortality curves. {[}control, heat-inactivated
virus, virus{]}

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate PNG}

Origin: Papua New Guinea; 4 replicates; 71 beetles in total

Mortality curves in 2 significantly different groups: {[}control,
heat-inactivated virus{]}, {[}virus{]}

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate V23B}

Origin: Solomon Islands; 4 repicates; 66 beetles in total

Mortality curves in 2 significantly different groups: {[}control,
heat-inactivated virus{]}, {[}virus{]}

\section{Environmental Cabinets and CRB Rearing}

Three environmental cabinets which allow control of temperature, relative
humidity, and lighting for insect rearing were procured and installed.
These chambers are set to maintain 30\textdegree{}C, 80\% RH and
12h photoperiod.

After a power outage caused by a typhoon, one of the cabinets malfunctioned.
It heated beyond the setpoint and killed all beetles. To prevent this
problem from recurring, controllers for all three units have been
programmed to send email to project staff whenever a fault is detected.

The project does not currently rear beetles form egg to adult. Because
CRB are so numerous on Guam, it is far more efficient to field collect
prepupae, pupae and adults and rear these to the age required for
bioassays. Adults are fed banana slices.

\section{Laboratory Bioassays of OrNV}

The major goal of this project is to find an effective biological

and the Solomon Islands. CRB-G has also invaded Oahu and Rota. Eradication
attempts have been launched on these two islands. 

The current project is part of an informal international collaboration
among Pacific island entomologist working to find solutions for CRB-G
management. The current focus is on testing new OrNV isolates in the
hope of finding on or more that can be used as an effective biological
control agent for CRB-G.

\section{CRB Damage Survey}
\begin{itemize}
\item A 360 degree digital camera and accessories were purchased.
\item A protocol for roadside CRB damage surveys using digital imagery was
developed and trial runs were made.
\item A workflow for scoring CRB damage from digital imagery is under development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Regional Collaboration}

Dr. Madoka Nakai, an insect pathologist from Tokyo University and
Dr. Shin Asano, an insect pathologist from Hokkaido University visited
Guam in November 2018 to collect CRB-G specimens.

Dr. Nakai returned to Guam in February 2019 with two students to collect
additional CRB-G specimens.
